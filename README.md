## About the project:

In this project I built a primitive instant messaging system, based on TCP/IP communication in java programming.
The program built on server and clients. The server starts itself and "listen" to the clients.
The client can connect, disconnect, send message to another client, send message to all the clients that are connected to the server now , and accept the customer names connected to the server.
